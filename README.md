# Luakit

luakit is a fast, light and simple to use micro-browser framework extensible by
Lua using the WebKit web content engine and the GTK+ toolkit.

## Dont Panic!

You don't have to be a developer to use luakit on a daily basis. If you are
familiar with vimperator, pentadactyl, jumanji, uzbl & etc you will find luakit
behaves similarly out of the box.

## Requirements

*   gtk2
*   Lua (5.1)
*   lfs (lua file system)
*   libwebkit (webkit-gtk)
*   libunique
*   sqlite3

## Compiling

To compile the stock luakit run:

    make

To link against LuaJIT (if you have LuaJIT installed) run:

    make USE_LUAJIT=1

To build without libunique (which uses dbus) run:

    make USE_UNIQUE=0

To build with a custom compiler run:

    make CC=clang

Note to packagers: you may wish to build luakit with:

    make DEVELOPMENT_PATHS=0

To prevent luakit searching in relative paths (`./config` & `./lib`) for user
configs.

The `USE_LUAJIT=1`, `USE_UNIQUE=0`, `PREFIX=/path`, `DEVELOPMENT_PATHS=0`,
`CC=clang` build options do not conflict. You can use whichever you desire.

## Installing

To install luakit run:

    sudo make install

The luakit binary will be installed at:

    /usr/local/bin/luakit

And configs to:

    /etc/xdg/luakit/

And the luakit libraries to:

    /usr/local/share/luakit/lib/

To change the install prefix you will need to re-compile luakit (after a `make
clean`) with the following option:

    make PREFIX=/usr
    sudo make PREFIX=/usr install

## Use Luakit

Just run:

    luakit [URI..]

Or to see the full list of luakit launch options run:

    luakit -h

## Configuration

The entire browsing experience is controlled by the configs in
`/etc/xdg/luakit`. Most of it is fine out of the box.

It is common to fork the configs from `/etc/xdg/luakit` into your home directory
to make your customizations. It is not necessary to copy and or edit all of the
files.

Do:

    mkdir -p $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
    cp -rv /etc/xdg/luakit $XDG_CONFIG_HOME

Or:

    mkdir -p ~/.config
    cp -rv /etc/xdg/luakit ~/.config

The several files of interest are explained below.

### `rc.lua`

This is the main config file which dictates which and in which order different
parts of the browser are loaded.

### `binds.lua`

Defines every action the browser takes when you press a button or combination of
buttons (even mouse buttons, direction key, etc) and the browser commands (I.e.
`:quit`, `:restart`, `:open`, `:lua <code>`, etc).

### `theme.lua`

Change fonts and colours used by the interface widgets.

### `window.lua`

Is responsible for building the luakit browser window and defining several
helper methods (I.e. `w:new_tab(uri)`, `w:close_tab()`, `w:close_win()`, etc).

### `webview.lua`

Is a wrapper around the webview widget object and is responsible for watching
webview signals (I.e. "key-press", "load-status", "resource-request-starting",
etc). This file also provides several window methods which operate on the
current webview tab (I.e. `w:reload()`, `w:eval_js("code here..")`, `w:back()`,
`w:forward()`).

### `modes.lua`

Manages the modal aspect of the browser and the actions that occur when
switching modes.

### `globals.lua`

Change global options like scroll/zoom step, default window size, useragent,
search engines, etc.

## Uninstall

To delete luakit from your system run:

    sudo make uninstall

If you installed with a custom prefix remember to add the identical prefix
here also, example:

    sudo make PREFIX=/usr uninstall
